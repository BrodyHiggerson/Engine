Frexx CPP (C Preprocessor)

Copyright (c) by Daniel Stenberg 1993 - 2011

This is a C preprocessor. It is a project based on public domain code, then
forked by Daniel in 1993 and future work has been done under a BSD license.

The C preprocessor is now (mostly?) ANSI C compliant, and some tweaks have
been applied to also make it fairly usable to process other data files, such
as HTML for simple web sites.

The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial
software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the
minor nuisance of being required to keep the above copyright notice
and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the
Public Domain "license" you can re-license your copy using whatever
license you like.
